- Features notification and reminder systems for both doctors and patients

### Treatment

- Manages patient treatment plans and medical history through dedicated API endpoints
- Enables doctors to create and manage prescriptions
- Integrates with pharmacy systems for streamlined prescription processing and fulfillment

## Technologies Used

- Node.js for building robust server-side applications
- Express.js for flexible web application framework capabilities
- MongoDB for storing and managing patient data and medical records
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication
- Calendar APIs for seamless scheduling and appointment management
- Pharmacy system APIs for efficient prescription and medication handling

## Setup Guide

### Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB database

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ````shell
   git clone https://github.com/areesha1122/Dr-Broker-Backend.git
   ```

   ````

2. Installing Dependencies:

   ````shell
   cd dr-broker-backend
   npm install
   ```

   ````

3. Environment Setup:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ````plaintext
   MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   ```

   Replace `your-mongodb-uri` with your MongoDB connection URI and `your-jwt-secret` with a secure secret for JWT token generation.

   ````

4. Launching the Server:

   ````shell
   npm start
   ```
   ````

## Operational Use

Once the server is up and running, you can interact with the API endpoints to manage doctor profiles, patient profiles, appointments, treatments, and medicines. The specific endpoints and usage will depend on the implementation details of your project.

You can integrate the backend with a frontend application or test the endpoints using API testing tools (e.g., Postman, curl).
